These are some AI algorithms that are implemented according to the question classes 
Astar , BFS, Bidirectional , DFS , UCS(uniform cost search) are used by qustion classes 1 ,2 ,3

DFS has three type of implementations in limited type and the iterative type and the simple one 

The 4th question is for Hillclimbing algorithm 
The Hillclimbing algorithm has 4 types of implementation : stochastic , first choice , random restart and simple

The 5th question is used for simulated annealing algorithm which has three ways of calculating the temperature

The 6th algorithm is used for Genetic algorithm 

the first question :
the problem of transfering people from one side of the river to another with just one boat and the limitation of maximum 2 person on the boat with the same gender or being couple 

The second question :
9 puzzle problem 

The third question :
is checker problem in which you have one knight and the limitation of not going specific houses and end in specific houses

The fourth question :
balanced queue

The fifth qustion :
rubik  

The sixth question :
graph coloring 

you can run algorithms by defined functions in main just by calling them
